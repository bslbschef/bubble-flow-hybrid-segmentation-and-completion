# bubble-flow-hybrid-segmentation-and-completion
This repository provides a hybrid framework for bubble flow image segmentation and completion. The pipeline includes three stages: CycleGAN-based image-to-mask translation, watershed-based instance segmentation of individual bubbles, and a U-net model for completing occluded or incomplete single-bubble images.
